As for my question: (assuming you felt the same way as me) how long did it take you to stop being paranoid about getting fat again, or to stop being so afraid of eating in a surplus?? I am in the midst of a bulk, and I am pretty terrified of putting on weight - even though I know that it is necessary to gain size and strength.

I decided I wanted my abs to be visible. I learned that for this to be possible, a body fat of ~10% or less was required. So in June, I downloaded MyFitnessPal and began counting my calories. It was also then that I adopted a vegan "diet", at first for nutritional benefits, and now for all sorts of reasons.

If you don't mind, I have some input to fine tune your progress. Feel free to pass it up if you do mind.

You have some muscle imbalances. Just by looking at what you are lifting.

&gt;   Bench: 195 lbs (5x5)

&gt;   Deadlift: 175 lbs (5x5)

&gt;   Squat: 155 lbs (4x6)

This is not ideal. 

Your bench press should never exceed your Deadlift or Squat.

A very basic and common ratio for bench:squat:deadlift is 3:4:5. 

If your bench is 195...

Your squat should be around 260.

Your deadlift should be around 325. 

I would work on that and you will find that everything else will skyrocket. Your running will benefit as well. So will your posture.

One thing I want to call out though, is that you do not want to simply roll back and forth. You want to sit on a spot until your muscles have relaxed around the roller or ball, and then move slowly, making sure you are relaxed the entire time.

If you simply roll back and forth, your muscles will be tense the entire time. The idea is for your muscles to relax. If you are moving fast, they will need to be tense and cannot relax."

Some of you were asking what my goals are or that I need to have a goal set to make sure I do not get discouraged. Do not worry, I have told myself that even if I don't lose anything (which I am) I will continue to live this way to make sure that I feel good throughout the day. The way that I now eat is healthy, but my 2000-2500 Cal goal went out the window, because I do not even want to eat that much. I have found out that because I only eat healthy foods, I can eat lots more and that allows me to eat less calories with the same or even more food. Due to this, I only eat around 1000-1500 Cal a day. Due to that and my daily walk, increasing it every time, I have lost 7 POUNDS (379) since my initial post (weighing in the morning). If anything I am doing is unhealthy, please tell me, although I feel quite good mentality wise and body wise! See you in the next update!***

My pcp straight up told me that I was either going to get a heart attack or stroke if I didn't change my lifestyle.  Proceeded to lose about 30 lbs, fit into clothes I've always wanted to wear, and just feel better about myself.  Health complications are a thing when you get older.  

Happy raving coming from another raver who got introduced to the scene in 2016."

**Post:**
> 5 years ago today my best friend dropped me off at Ronald Reagan Hospital. I was 435 lbs, struggling with addiction, and eating myself to death. After coming home from Iraq, I tried to numb the pain with pills, alcohol, and food. I was lost, scared, and slowly dying.
> 
> That day, I made a choice: enough was enough. I took my life back.
> 
> Since then, I’ve lost over 200 lbs, graduated from UCLA School of Law, passed the California Bar, and transformed not just my body, but my mind and spirit. I’ve watched people come and go, but one constant has been fitness and the unwavering support of the gym community.
> 
> To everyone who’s shown love and support along the way: thank you.
> 
> If you think this journey has been something, just wait for 2025. Baby, we’re just getting started!

**Post:**
> Over 3 years, I have lost and kept off almost 90lbs. I have fluctuated my weight a few times and struggled to maintain. When I wad 90lbs heavier, sad, and struggling not many people reached out to see if i was ok. The ones who did are the most important people in my life. They were there to pick me up when i could not get off the floor. 
> •
> After losing the weight and being honest about my past, people began to worry. I have been called too skinny. Those same people never seemed worried when i was quiet and way out of shape. I have worked very hard to get to where i am mentally and physically. If i was even more honest about my past, it would shock most people that i am still here and functioning at the capacity I am able to function. 
> •
> I suffer from C-PTSD. I struggle with confidence. I have a hard time trusting myself. I have put my trust in the wrong people. My mother killed herself. I was raised by a drug addict who did not have her kids. I have been beaten, abused, threatened, and mocked all before the age of 10. I have felt ignored, pushed aside, and forgotten about.

> I may be writing this to the emptiness that is the internet. However, i am writing this for anyone who has gone through anything similar. If you surround yourself with people you love and who love you back, you can conquer a lot. If you can get help get it. If you need help reach out. I understand fear, anxiety, and pain more than most. You are not alone. I may not be able to help, however i will always

**Post:**
> I wanted to share my transformation and journey. It all started because of Nikocado Avocado. When he dropped his "two steps ahead" video, that was my wake-up call. I went to the gym that same day 🤣and decided to lock in. Was hard at the start was losing motivation as I have pretty severe facial dysmorphia most of my life which  I still struggle with so I avoid mirrors getting better recently but still always nit pick my face . A whole new world now just dawned on me recently that I actually did it on my own with just diet and exercise. Only thing Im still working on is my self confidence growing up that weird fat kid that always got rejected does numbers on your mental😭 but we committed will overcome that soon 💪🏾.

**Post:**
> Started my journey in January 2023 at 488 lbs (221.4kgs). Today, I’m 184 lbs (83.7kgs) — something I never thought I’d be able to say.
> 
> It hasn’t been easy. I’ve had hospital stays for mental health, battled self-doubt, and there are still days I see the “old me” in the mirror. But I’ve kept going — one day, one step, one meal at a time — and it’s completely changed my life.

> Do I still treat myself? Hell yeah! Life’s about balance — enjoying things in moderation, not punishment.

> Highlights:
> No more seatbelt extenders ✈️
> Diabetes — gone
> Sleep apnea — gone
> Tick-off bucket list: hot-air ballooning 🎈(now to complete the rest). 
> Been told to stop losing weight for the first time ever 😂
> 
> And I’m now smaller than my brother, some friends, and even my nephews — which still feels wild!
