### A Cautionary Tale: Waiting on your avoidant partner to change

**Post:**
> 46M and earlier this year, my wife (41F) - a woman I once thought I’d grow old with - ended our 16-year relationship. Our marriage of 11 years, on the surface, was decent. We were stable, respectful, and functional. But underneath that, it lacked intimacy, both emotional and physical.

> She is an amazing lady, attractive, intelligent and a great conversationalist, and a great mother.
> 
> After our second child, sex died a slow and painful death until it all but disappeared. Conversations became transactional. Routine consumed affection. I planned the date nights, organised babysitters, did the “choreplay”.
> 
> I spent years trying to fix it. I read the books, lurked in these subs, listened to the podcasts, initiated the tough talks, and got us in for counselling. I sought individual therapy, I took responsibility for my part, my flaws, my stress, my moods and anger, and worked to improve myself. I was the breadwinner, but also did my share of household duties. I wasn’t perfect, but I was committed. But still, nothing changed. My wife’s avoidant attachment style resisted vulnerability, closeness, or even acknowledging that things weren’t working. Over time, I became the overly anxious pursuer emotionally worn out, constantly second-guessing myself, and slowly losing confidence. My attempts to bring us closer only pushed her further away.

I'm a recovering avoidant who has been with another avoidant for decades. It turns out it is not normal to feel dead and empty on the inside and checked out of your own life. I've learned and grown a lot lately. STBXW on the other hand hasn't grown at all. Even during the crisis period, she couldn't grow. She resisted professional help at every turn. It was me who was having a marriage crisis. Not her. She had nothing to do with it and it wasn't her problem. Even the divorce is MY divorce.

Anyway, I'm looking forward to a new future where emotions are my friends, and connection and care gets a central role for once."

We lived a very comfortable life, and yet I was constantly reminded of what we didn’t have compared to others. Friends who made more. Friends who had more. Somehow, that always became the focus. It never felt like our life was enough. And I never felt like I was enough.

People don't just suddenly change.  Not if they're \[reasonably\] happy and fulfilled.  There's a reason for this, something he's not telling you.

&gt;He began listing everything that was “wrong” with our marriage, insisting he wasn’t happy and that, apparently, I wasn’t either — news to me.

Classic blame shifting.  He feels guilty about something. The more faults he can find in your marriage, the less guilty he has to feel about hurting you.

> After a separation, you do not just lose a relationship. You lose an identity.
> 
> Marriage gives men a social role and a kind of quiet status, whether they consciously recognize it or not. You are a husband, a father in a shared household, a man with a home, routines, and visible markers that signal stability to the outside world. When that structure disappears, it can feel like the floor drops out from under you. The house may be gone. The assets are divided. Your standing in your community shifts. The version of yourself that made sense to others and to you becomes fractured.

I dont' think they're trying so much to alienate lifters as much as trying to make it seem more friendly to the intimidated. I've never had any real problems at my local PF, and they had a decent range of equipment. But it did crack me up that they had a bazillion treadmills and only 2 or 3 squat racks. However, rarely did I have any problem getting a rack to myself, unless it was late Saturday morning, when the teenagers were down there. 

The truth is that the guys who *do* want to work out won't be intimidated anyway, and unless they actively discourage lifting (which I've heard rumors that some PFs are doing), then it's just some funny commercials.

ETA: I left there because I set up a home gym, which I use much more often."

Having clear, shared intentions from the beginning what we both wanted from life, our values, our commitment to support each other would have helped us steer through the tougher times.

Get your ducks in a row and divorce his ass! Get you and your kids into therapy as well. Not sure if you're in a at fault state, but take him to the cleaners.

Just disgusting, going after your own son's girlfriend even before they broke up since you said the affair went on for 6 months and they only been broken up for 2 months.

If you sit on this for Christmas, chznces are you are going to hurt your son even more. He will only look back at this time as the time both parents betrayed him. There is no softening the blow. Tell him immediately

Lawyer up. Like yesterday. 

There is no good time to get that kind of news. There is no fixing this. And you are not responsible for your husband 's choices. Keeping them hidden won't help"

### My (22f) birth control was tampered with by my boyfriend (22m). I'm pregnant. I don't know what to do.

**Post:**
> My boyfriend (22m) and I (22f) have been together for 3 years. We were high school friends, grew apart, ended up going to the same college, similar majors, reconnected, you can guess the rest. 
> 
> We've been on the rocks lately. Our lifestyles just don't align very well, and sometimes he treats me more like a mother than a partner. I am losing patience.
> 
> He is an only child, and kind of a massive momma's boy. His mom is nice enough, just very traditional. Until recently, I don't feel like I've had a reason to distrust her. He confides in her a lot about our relationship, sometimes an uncomfortable amount. For the past couple of months, I feel like she's been trying to plant seeds in my head about having kids when I'm alone with her.

This is not a safe person to have in your life, nor is he safe to raise a child. Him and his mom — your description of his mom makes me think they did this together or it was her idea.

A word of advice: if you do decide to terminate, tell him you miscarried. He doesn’t deserve the truth, and you don’t deserve whatever terrible response he and his mom would direct your way. 

You need to put yourself first and decide what you want your life to be. Good luck, OP."

Do look at ineedana (.org) and other support services so you can decide what is best for you. Have a friend drive you if need be, label it as a weekend trip. If you do get one lie and say you miscarried.

> I said she needs to leave her personal trainer, Quit that gym, and we need to start going to couples counselling. She wasn’t happy and started arguing saying it’s only a crush and it’ll pass and she’s making good progress and then started to frame it as me not caring about her health. Once she realised I wasn’t budging she started trying to bargain with me and saying what if she stopped seeing the personal trainer could she still go to the gym and if she started having sex with me again we don’t need couples counselling.

I want to see these outfits you are wearing! I need to know everything now!” She said fine and stormed off upstairs. She came back down wearing an outfit that was a bit much to be fair for the gym in a cold country but I didn’t say anything and asked to see her phone. She said she deleted the messages.

### My (M30) partner (F28) kept secret how much money she has in savings and let me pay for most things

**Post:**
> We’ve been dating for nearly 5y and in that time I’ve always had a full time job earning average money and she has been studying with part time jobs earning far less. I had almost no savings and we never really gave details about how much we had in savings until maybe a year or so ago.

> Over this period she has always said she couldn’t afford things and I’ve paid a larger portion of rent (probably 70%) since we moved out together 3 years ago.

> I’ve never wanted to let money get in the way of living/our lives and could probably do a bit better job of saving. And I was always happy to pay more until she also started working full time when we would start splitting things evenly.

> My dad passed away unexpectedly and he left me $500,000 which I got about 6 months ago - which is obviously life changing, I’ve probably never had more than $10,000 in my savings. We’ve started the process of buying a house and i was happy to put most of the money into a deposit and pay a larger portion of the mortgage until she started full time work (2y away).

I get that she wouldn’t mention this when we first started dating, and I don’t even care about the amount, but she has actively said “I can’t afford this” and let me pay for things countless times.
