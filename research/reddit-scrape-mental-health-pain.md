I ended up not doing that and my wife( girlfriend at the time) was devastated mind you she was the sweetest girl ever I completely hurt her so much and she loved me so much .

> "You are a victim of emotional abuse.

I want you to reread that sentence until it sinks in.

I divorced my emotionally abusive ex, who had severe mental health issues. Yes, there was guilt at first, but once I understood that I was a victim of abuse, all of that went away.

What you have to understand is that it doesn't matter why she is abusive. There is no explanation for why she treats you this way that excuses.

Let me repeat that. There is no excuse for her being abusive toward you.

Yes, her mental health issues are not her fault. Yes, she may not be able to control how she acts. (Though you did mention she is not like this toward others. Think on that.) None of that matters. None of that excuses her abuse toward you.

Over 2 years in, we love each other, but agree that we do not communicate properly and struggle to even though we have said so many times we want and need to change. We don’t mesh well and can barely ever compromise. After our first year of marriage it triggered an anxiety disorder for me. A year later I got a severe intestinal infection. I’m aware the gut and brain are connected and since I’m young and otherwise healthy I believe the chronic stress caused by my marriage led to me being more susceptible to the infection. It came back once after two months and now two months later after finishing treatment..we are struggling again (not that it ever really stopped but I feel it more acutely. It’s like once my health improves a little and I’m more stable we argue more) .. I don’t feel well and I’m so afraid it will come back. I’m not having panic/anxiety attacks all the time anymore but the stress is always there because we have completely lost our love and connection. Im always overwhelmed and down. I’m constantly wishing for more from my husband and emotionally he cannot give anymore. I straight up tell him what I need or what he does that hurts me and he just doesn’t get it. It’s so upsetting. I’m wondering if this marriage has destroyed me and my health. Has anyone’s anxiety and health substantially improved after divorce? Anyone else relate? I don’t know what to do.

That doesn't scare me, I'm prepared to be alone and not be constantly betrayed by an entitled man who cares nothing of my feelings. I've always felt searching out other women for the sole purpose of sexually arousing yourself to another woman and using her for full sexual gratification as cheating especially when you've rejected your wife first so you can do this. I've expressed this to him and he labels me as all of the above. I've tried watching it with him, I found it unhelpful, I was not aroused and I couldn't enjoy sex with him staring at a screen and ignoring my needs.

Intimacy does not damage male mental health (unless there are extenuating circumstances such as a history of being sexually abused).

Pleasuring a woman sexually does nothing to damage a man's dignity. (I would argue the opposite, in fact.)

My best guess would be that he feels emasculated by not working and taking care of domestic duties. I imagine he cannot lash out against his role as domestic caretaker because he feels it is currently the only "value" he brings to the table, and so he's lashing out against something else he perceives as feminine.

It's also possible that he has a great degree of anxiety about sexual performance and is acting out in defence.

I would delay sex for now until you are both on the same page.

**Post:**
> I will flat out say I do not have underlying mental health problems. Everyone wants to put a label on everything. You are organized does NOT mean you have OCD. It means you are not a fucking slob. Being energetic does NOT mean you have ADHD. It means you are energetic. The list goes on. I am sick of going to my providers and saying I have insomnia and being told / asked "What is the problem, is it anxiety or depression or \_\_\_". 
> 
> Nope. I have insomnia. I don't lay in bed thinking about anything other than "wow I cannot get to sleep".
