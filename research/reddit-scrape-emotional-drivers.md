People don't just suddenly change.  Not if they're \[reasonably\] happy and fulfilled.  There's a reason for this, something he's not telling you.

&gt;He began listing everything that was “wrong” with our marriage, insisting he wasn’t happy and that, apparently, I wasn’t either — news to me.

Classic blame shifting.  He feels guilty about something. The more faults he can find in your marriage, the less guilty he has to feel about hurting you.

This will be long, but the closest I can manage to a TLDR is: Together 22 years, non-monogamous the whole time, partner developed a pattern of only being sexual in the beginning of new relationships and then quickly falling off. I gained 100 lbs and got depressed and blamed my body for our problems, lost the weight but nothing changed, finally moved out at 41 and now have a healthy relationship with another partner, but am mourning my marriage and trying to navigate a friendship with a person I love who still wants to be my husband.

### I think I (32F) nuked my relationship with my boyfriend (32M) by drawing a hard line.

> My boyfriend and I have been together for nearly two years, living together for one. He had purchased his house prior to us dating, and I was renting an apartment, so it made sense for me to move in to his house. He continued to pay the mortgage and I took on all of the “usage” bills - all of the utilities and annual maintenance as well as the grocery shopping &amp; we felt that it was a fair split.

> As our anniversary is coming up we’ve been talking about our future timelines and where we see our relationship progressing. We’re on the same page with all the big ideas - we know we want to marry each other and start a family following that. But to be in a position to start a family, the house is going to need a lot of renovations &amp; we’ve always thrown around the idea that the cost of renos would be my “buy-in” so to say on the house. From our estimates, everything we would want to do would be around $100k at the low end. We even agreed that we could draw up some kind of agreement to protect both of our interests financially.

> My girlfriend of 2 years and I were recently having one of those drunk tell me something shocking conversations. Everything was lighthearted until she dropped something that completely rewrote the origin story of how we became a couple, something I’ve always held as a romantic and somewhat dramatic beginning.
> 
> A little over a month into dating, I told her I wanted to be exclusive. Up to that point, everything between us, her behavior, our connection, the way she talked about us, made me feel like she was on the same page. But during that conversation, she suddenly got overwhelmed, said she needed to leave, and basically walked out. I was confused and pretty upset. I went home thinking maybe that was it.
> 
> A few hours later, she called, said she wanted to talk, and drove to my place. That night, outside my apartment, in the rain, she told me she did want to be in a committed relationship, and that she had just needed time to “meditate” and collect her thoughts. I took it as a cinematic beginning to our relationship.

At first I thought it was just poor timing on your part. Like you guys weren't exclusive, she was seeing other people, and you just unknowingly asked her to go exclusive after she had sex with someone else. And I usually err on the side of "well you weren't exclusive so you shouldn't be too hung up on it". 

But she left and went to go have sex with him one last time?! Cheating or not that's kinda fucked up. A guy asked her to be exclusive, whom she wanted to be exclusive with apparently, and her first thought was "lemme go fuck that other guy one more time"??? That paints a horrible picture of her if you ask me. 

And on top of that she doesn't find what she did weird at all? Like she'd be perfectly find if you had fucked someone else in that time when she went off to go fuck someo"

> My boyfriend (26M) and I (26F) have been dating for about six months. A couple of months ago, I got a job in NYC, while he’s been unemployed for about seven months.

> I commute into the city every day, and while the train ride itself isn’t awful, the time, cost, and overall exhaustion are really starting to wear on me. Living in the city would make my life significantly easier. My lease ends in a couple months, and one of my best friends from home (we’ve been close for 15 years) has also been planning to move to NYC, so we decided to get a place together. She’s single, social, and enjoys going out, which feels pretty normal for people in their mid-to-late 20s.

> My boyfriend keeps saying that since we’re “almost 30,” we should be settling down and be done with going out. He’s also told me that if I keep going out, I’ll “never find my husband.” For context, I have a close group of girlfriends and always have. I used to go out more, but now it’s usually just drinks once or twice a week - nothing extreme.
> 
> I’m really conflicted. If I stay where I am, it’s not like my boyfriend and I would be moving in together anyway. He lives with his parents and doesn’t currently have the money to get his own place. Staying would basically just mean we don’t break up.

For the past couple of months, I feel like she's been trying to plant seeds in my head about having kids when I'm alone with her.

A word of advice: if you do decide to terminate, tell him you miscarried. He doesn’t deserve the truth, and you don’t deserve whatever terrible response he and his mom would direct your way.
