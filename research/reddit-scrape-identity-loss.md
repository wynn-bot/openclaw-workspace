> This is going to be a long vent. Wife (30F) told me(34M) the day after Christmas that she wanted a divorce. Then finally moved out with a friend on my birthday. Everything was really rough for a while. I would have at least a daily breakdown crying. Every night I would have dreams of us fixing everything. It was horrible. She claims I was too clingy (More of I really lost touch with friends during our relationship). And she lost her identity because I did everything for her, chores, cooking, driving etc. This part upset me because she never TRIED to do any of these things. She never tried to do the dishes, any time i offered to let her drive she would refuse, etc.

The next day she said we needed to talk, she barely said 4 sentences, said what is written above, said she needed time &amp; space, didn't specify what that meant, didn't tell me anything, turned off her location services and left. The next day I signed up for therapy again, it was great though private therapy is expensive. I participated in a daily online course, seeing a clinical psychologist, and a therapist. I did not call, text, or look for her since she needed space, however not knowing anything was frustrating.

People don't just suddenly change.  Not if they're \[reasonably\] happy and fulfilled.  There's a reason for this, something he's not telling you.

&gt;He began listing everything that was “wrong” with our marriage, insisting he wasn’t happy and that, apparently, I wasn’t either — news to me.

Classic blame shifting.  He feels guilty about something. The more faults he can find in your marriage, the less guilty he has to feel about hurting you.

> 
> After a separation, you do not just lose a relationship. You lose an identity.
> 
> Marriage gives men a social role and a kind of quiet status, whether they consciously recognize it or not. You are a husband, a father in a shared household, a man with a home, routines, and visible markers that signal stability to the outside world. When that structure disappears, it can feel like the floor drops out from under you. The house may be gone. The assets are divided. Your standing in your community shifts. The version of yourself that made sense to others and to you becomes fractured.

She's open that it's fully overwhelming for her, especially because she works part time from home too. So when I am home she openly asks me to do the huge majority of the parenting and the house chores. She says without me there that the house falls apart (and she's right) and I come home to the house in total disarray, piles of dishes everywhere, old food dry and crusted thought the kitchen, days of clothes just piled up on the floor, empty baby bottles just strewn on the ground and not picked up. Things that are not like her when I am around, but being alone overwhelms her. So when I am home, since the baby has been born, I've had hours and hours of house cleaning to do whenever I come home, plus being essentially the only parent (as she was when I was gone), and cook and handle all the neglected additional house chores.

> Recently found out my wife cheated on me through some messages. We have been married for 4 years and the last 8 months we were having stale and lack of love and intimacy. About two weeks ago she told me she wanted a divorce and she feels nothing when she looks at me. When I found out the text they were very explicit, everything I ever wanted her to tell me she told him. “You know my body so well, I can’t wait to see you” “I been thinking about you all day” “you make me excited to see you”. Last night she had to stay away and told me she realize her mistake and she wanted to make it work with me, I allowed her to come home and we were intimate and hugged. This morning we talk and I told her to block him, she said “if he text me one more time I will block him” I asked her if she has any desire to cut contact with him and she said “no we had sex and that is very symbolic and he helped me with the pain I was experiencing with the marriage” I ended up telling her not to block him and I wanted her to come to that assumption. She has never cried when she told me she cheated and I fear that I’m just delaying it to happen again. I want to work on us and forgive but she asked me to not love bomb her and to just keep it chill, you know “babe, I love you and other things” I’m afraid I can’t “keep it chill” and I just want her to be in our daughters and my life. Is this a normal behavior? Did i already lost her and she wants to cling on to me for support? Does she even love me? Thank you
